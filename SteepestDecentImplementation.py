#optimizing the path of a robot around obstacles using steepest decent
#c1 and c2 are "weights" (constants) that determine the effect of each term on the value of F(xi).
#c1 controls the 'loss' the objective function suffers for getting close to the obstacles.
#c2 controls the 'loss' the objective function suffers for having very long line segments.
#k is the number of obstacles your robot must avoid.
#given an initial path matrix, X, comprised of n+1 vectors (each with 2 coordinates) x0,x1,x2,x3...xn. 
#The start and end points of your path are fixed, and are given by x0 and xn
#Given certain point obstacles (vectors with 2 coordinates), ri, in the obstacle matrix  R
